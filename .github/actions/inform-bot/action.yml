      Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is
      configured with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run
      authenticated git commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.

      We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
      Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
